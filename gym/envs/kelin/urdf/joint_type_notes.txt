NOTES on URDF Joint types
0: revolute
0?: continuous
2: prismatic
3: 
4: fixed
5: planar

revolute - a hinge joint that rotates along the axis and has a limited range specified by the upper and lower limits.
continuous - a continuous hinge joint that rotates around the axis and has no upper and lower limits.
prismatic - a sliding joint that slides along the axis, and has a limited range specified by the upper and lower limits.
fixed - This is not really a joint because it cannot move. All degrees of freedom are locked. This type of joint does not require the axis, calibration, dynamics, limits or safety_controller.
floating - This joint allows motion for all 6 degrees of freedom.
planar - This joint allows motion in a plane perpendicular to the axis.
